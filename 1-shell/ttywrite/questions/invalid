Because the type of flow_control(-f) argument is enum serial_core::FlowControl, which defined as "FlowNone, FlowSoftware or FlowHardware".
And the flow_control argument can only be parsed with the parser "parse_flow_control" defined in the parses module.
Any option that isn't inclued in the serial_core::FlowControl will be rejected by the parser "parser_flow_control".
