A synchronous exception is generated by executing instructions, 
and thus executing SVC instruction can cause synchronous exception.
Exception will never be token in EL0, which means it will be token to EL1.
Therefore, for the synchronous exception which is lower exception level, 
where the implemented level immediately lower than the target level is using AArch64, 
the VBAR is stored in VBAR_EL1.
Then the CPU should jump to VBAR_EL1 + 0x400.
