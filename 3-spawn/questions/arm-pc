<Xn> is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose register holding the address to be branched to, encoded in the "Rn" field. Defaults to X30 if absent.
So when using RET to return from subroutine, address A should be writen to the Xn first.
When ERET is executed, the PE restores PSTATE from SPSR, and brances to the address A held in the ELR.
